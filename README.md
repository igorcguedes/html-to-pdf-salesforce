# html-to-pdf-salesforce
Code using jspdf and html2canvas to generate a pdf.

Using this method you can use CSS without problems, flexbox, etc.
I also recommend define the width of the page.

Example at salesforce with action to see the page:

Limitations:
The CSS needs to be in the <style>, cannot be in a external file.
